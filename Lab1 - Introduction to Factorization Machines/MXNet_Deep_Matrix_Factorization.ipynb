    "## Deep Matrix Factorization Using Apache MXNet: The Engine for a Better Recommendation Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation engines are widely used models that attempt to identify items that a person will like based on that person's past behavior. We're all familiar with Amazon's recommendations based on your past purchasing history, and Netflix recommending shows to you based on your history and the ratings you've given other shows. Naturally, machine learning is behind many of these systems. In this tutorial we will delve into how to use machine learning to build these recommender systems, and specifically how to implement a technique called matrix factorization using Apache MXNet. It presumes basic familiarity with MXNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization is a linear method, meaning that if there are complicated non-linear interactions going on in the dataset, a simple dot product may not be able to handle it well. Given the recent success of deep learning in complicated non-linear computer vision and natural language processing tasks, it is natural to want to find a way to incorporate it into matrix factorization as well. A way to do this is called \"deep matrix factorization\" and involves the replacement of the dot product with a neural network that is trained jointly with the factors. This makes the model more powerful because a neural network can model important non-linear combinations of factors to make better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional matrix factorization the prediction is the simple dot product between the factors for each of the dimensions. In contrast, in deep matrix factorization the factors for both are concatenated together and used as the input to a neural network whose output is the prediction. The parameters in the neural network are then trained jointly with the factors to produce a sophisticated non-linear model for matrix factorization. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will apply deep matrix factorization concepts to model the MovieLens 20M dataset. We'll explore how one can use recent advances in deep learning and the flexibility of neural networks to build more complex models. While this may sound complicated, fortunately Apache MXNet makes it easy!"

    "One aspect of deep matrix factorization's flexibility with the `output_dim` size of the embedding layers. This is useful in the case where one dimension may be significantly larger than the other and thus requires training a massive number of factors. In the MovieLens case there are significantly more users (~138k) than there are movies (~27k). By changing the number of user factors from 25 to 15 we can reduce the number of parameters by 1.38 million while not losing any expressivity on the movie side. The only change is changing the value of `output_dim` in the user embedding layer.\n",

We can specify the number of epochs that we would like to train for, the validation set data through eval_data, and the metric used to evaluate both the training and validation sets during training. In this case we choose root mean squared error (rmse), which is a common choice in regression problems such as thisâ€”it penalizes large errors more than small ones. This makes sense in a recommendation context, where offering a user something slightly unexpected may be a virtue, but getting a recommendation totally wrong will be off-putting to your user.[Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#Adam) is a popular optimizer that can automatically tune the learning rate to get better results, and we can specify that we want to use it by adding in `optimizer='adam'` to the `fit` function."

    "This technique is useful in a setting where you may run out of memory due to the size of the matrix being completed, or as a way to reduce overfitting by using a simpler model. One can imagine that perhaps movies might be difficult to appropriately represent and have many aspects that should be modeled, whereas users are simpler and only have a few features that are relevant. Being able to tune the size of these embedding layers is a very useful tool.\n",

    "Next, we can extend matrix factorization past using only two embedding layers. The MovieLens dataset comes with genres for each of the films. Presumably genre is one of the major aspects that would be learned by the movie embedding layer already, so explicitly including that information can be beneficial. More broadly, perhaps there are some features that are common to a ~genre~ of films instead of an individual film. By modeling the genre of film as its own embedding layer, we can train these factors using all films of a given genre instead of trying to learn the value of the respective factor for each movie individually. Since we've already seen that the number of factors in each layer can be variable, we don't need to be concerned with the size of any of these layers. We can see that visually below. Assuming that movies have been sorted by genre, we can see that half of the movie factors now correspond more broadly to the genre that they are in and are shared across movies, while the other half are still movie specific factors. The change to the network is conceptually very simple, now concatenating three embedding layers to be the input to the network instead of only two.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we investigated deep matrix factorization and showed how one would use Apache MXNet to implement these models. Since these types of matrix factorization models are commonly used to build recommender systems, we showed how to build models to predict user ratings of movies using the MovieLens 20M dataset. We saw that deep matrix factorization can natively take advantage of the recent advances in deep learning to learn more sophisticated models. In addition, deep matrix factorization can take advantage of the flexibility afforded by neural networks to allow more complicated inputs than traditional matrix factorization can handle that could yield additional insight into the task. Apache MXNet makes doing all of this simple, as with only about two dozen lines of code one can define both the model and how to train it. Since MXNet is built with distributed computing in mind it is easy to take advantage of those built-in features to scale this type of model up to massive datasets that can't fit in memory.\n",
